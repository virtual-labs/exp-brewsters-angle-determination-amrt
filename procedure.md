### Procedure

### Performing the Simulation:

- Drag the components from the right panel and place them correctly in the optic bench.
- **Start** : This button enables the user to start the experiment.
- **Side view/Top view** : Using this, different views of the experimental arrangement can be seen.
- **Choose light** : Using this combo box, one can select different lasers.
- **Choose medium** : The medium of different refractive index can be selected using this combo box.
- **Choose material** : Different materials can be selected using this combo box.
- **Switch on light** : The user can make the laser source ON/OFF using this button.
- **Angle of the polariser** : Using this slider, one can change the angle of the polariser from zero to 360 degrees.
- **Angle of incidence** : This slider helps one to change the angle of incidence, which can be varied from zero to 360 degrees.
- **Reset** : The experimental arrangement can be reset using this button.
